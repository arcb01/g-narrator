In many videogames, the use of the mouse for controlling the camera is often used. On the other hand, the magnifier app which makes the elements on the screen appear larger, also makes use of the movement of the mouse to move arround the screen. These two behaviours collide between each oder if they wanna be performed simultaniously. In other words, while playing a videogame one is not able to use the magnifier app and mouve the mouse around the screen. 
To solve this problem, I created this application to help me read what's on the screen using text-to-speech.

Notes:
This accessibility feature should be included in all games. This application can serve as inspiration for encouraging game developers to include this kind of accessibility features in their games.
