# Concept
Exploring the idea of incorporating visual language models to the narrator to enhance its capabilities.
Below is a conceptual diagram illustrating how this integration might work. 

The system would use a Visual Question Answering (VQA) approach:
- Input: A visual question is presented to the system, often related to the contents of an image.
- Output: The system provides an answer based on the image and the question.
