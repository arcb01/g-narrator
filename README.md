In many videogames, the use of the mouse for controlling the camera is often used. On the other hand, the magnifier app which makes the elements on the screen appear larger, also makes use of the movement of the mouse to move arround the screen. These two behaviours collide between each oder if they wanna be performed simultaniously. In other words, while playing a videogame one is not able to use the magnifier app and mouve the mouse around the screen. 
This is the main reason why I wanted to build an application to help me read what's on the screen by using text-to-speech.

When it comes to usage, it can be used by everyone. However, people having some kind of visual imparement will benefit the most from using it. Furthurmore, this application could also serve as inspiration for encouraging game developers to include this kind of accessibility feature inside their games. 

## Requirements
Cuerrently, the application is **only available for Windows**, since the majority of videogames are played in this OS. 

## How to use?
