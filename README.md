This project is proposed as an easy-to-use and functional alternative to the conventional narrator, with the aim of being a useful tool especially for low vision users.

## Initial motivation
In many videogames, the use of the mouse for controlling the camera is often used. On the other hand, the magnifier app which makes the elements on the screen appear larger, also makes use of the movement of the mouse to move around the screen. These two behaviors collide between each other if they wanna be performed simultaneously. In other words, while playing a videogame one is not able to use the magnifier app and move the mouse around the screen. 
Adiotionally, tools like, for example, Windows Narrator do not work in these scenarios.

## Application demo
In the following video it is shown how the application works:
1. The user can choose betweem 2 modes, full screen or regional:
   - Full screen: The whole screen is scanned.
   - Region: Define a region of the screen to be scanned.
2. Once scanned, the user can interact with the detected regions and choose one to be read out loud.
