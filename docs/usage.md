# Getting Started
## Requirements & installation
### Requirements
- **OS**: Primarly Windows, but not tested on Linux or Mac OS

- **Suported languages**: English and Spaniash

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - GPU is recomended for faster inference times.

### Installation
- Run the `run.bat` and let the installation follow.

## How to use?
Frist and foremost, custom key bindings must be defined. To do so, edit the file `config/keys.json`. Here there's a description of what's the role of each key.
Keys descriptions:

`"CAPTURE":` This key will take a screenshot

`"SWITCH_FORWARD":` Move to the next detection 

 `"SWITCH_BACKWARD":` Move to previous detection
 
 `"REPEAT":` Repeat text at a slower pase 
 
 `"READ_OUT_LOUD":` Text-to-speech 
 
 `"QUIT":` Exit key. It will clear the screen aswell

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key binding names must be in the same language as your OS.

Once all keys have been set, you can run the app in the background and start using it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
Remember that the game you want to play must be set to **borderless**. Otherwise, the application will not work</ins>
