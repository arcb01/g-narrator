## How to use?
1. First and foremost, watch the demo video on the README to get an introduction on how the app works.
2. Set your prefered key bindings by editing `/config/keys.json/` file
3. Start the app by running the `run.bat` file

> [!NOTE]

**Bug list**
- [ ] Region mode + Full screen mode combination crashes (viceversa aswell?)
